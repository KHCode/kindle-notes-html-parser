As with other periods, the literature on Reconstruction seems divided between broad studies of national politics that all but ignore the social ferment within the South, and detailed accounts of individual communities or states, or of a single aspect of Southern life, isolated from the era’s political history and from a broader national or regional context.

I have tried to show, however, that instead of proceeding in a linear, predetermined fashion, these developments arose from a complex series of interactions among blacks and whites, Northerners and Southerners, in which victories were often tentative and outcomes subject to challenge and revision.

I have chosen the conventional date of 1877 to close this account (with a brief look at the New South that followed), because although the process of social change did not abruptly end in that year, the fall of the South’s last Republican governments and the removal of federal troops from a role in regional politics

marked a definitive turning point in American history. My opening is more unusual, for the book begins not in 1865 (or, as others would insist, in 1861), but with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. I do this to emphasize the Proclamation’s importance in uniting two major themes of this study—grass-roots black activity and the newly empowered national state—and to indicate that Reconstruction was not merely a specific time period, but the beginning of an extended historical process: the adjustment of American society to the end of slavery.

It is probably most accurate to say that Lincoln, neither an egalitarian in a modern sense nor a man paralyzed, like so many of his contemporaries, by racial fears and prejudices, did not approach any policy, even emancipation, primarily in terms of its impact upon blacks; for him, winning the war always remained paramount.
